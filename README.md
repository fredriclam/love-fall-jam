## Doomed Descent

2-player cooperative 2-D platformer game made in LOVE2D by [fredric.lam](https://www.fredric.ca) @ [Stanford Fall Game Jam 2018](https://www.svgadev.com/), themed *fall*.

Hold out on a strange platform as you get attacked by alien shards of red and blue. The catch: each player can only shoot down one of the two types, so you have to depend on your cooperative partner.

Made using only hand-rolled asset and code, on an open-source framework. Fueled by coffee and bubble tea.
