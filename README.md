## Doomed Descent

2-player cooperative 2-D platformer game made in LOVE2D by [fredric.lam](fredric.ca) @ [Stanford Fall Game Jam 2018](https://www.svgadev.com/), themed *fall*.

Hold out on a strange platform as you get attacked by alien shards of red and blue. The catch: each player can only shoot down one of the two types, so you have to depend on your cooperative partner.

The goal of this project was to explore LOVE2D as an option for developing a 16-bit style MOBA, and to celebrate open source!

Made using only hand-rolled asset and code, on an open-source framework. Fueled by coffee and bubble tea.
